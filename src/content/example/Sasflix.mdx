Sasflix Test App is a simple test task built with TypeScript, Nuxt 3, Pinia and TailwindCSS, designed to fetch and display posts from DummyJSON. The app shows 5 posts on the homepage, allows users to open them, like posts, and delete comments with actions stored in cookies.

What makes this project interesting is how I adapted the Nuxt app to run within Astro. By implementing hash-based routing, the app remains fully functional while embedded in Astro. With minimal adjustments, it’s possible to move API calls from Vue components to Astro, making the app fully SSR-compatible.

## ✨ Features:

- Reworked the Nuxt app to run inside Astro with hash routing.
- Maintains full functionality, including dynamic routing and interactivity.
- Demonstrates how easily a Vue app can be integrated into an Astro environment.
- Can be further optimized for SSR with slight adjustments to API logic
