*⚠️ Work in progress! Expect some surprises along the way.*

This is not just another REST API template—it's **Fastify with flair**! 🎉  
Under the hood, we’ve got **Fastify** and **Prisma**, so you know it’s all about speed, reliability, and modern vibes.  

## What’s inside?  
- 🔒 **Local authentication**: Because no one likes uninvited guests.  
- ⚡ **Redis-powered sessions**: Fast, efficient, and headache-free.  
- 🤖 **Telegram Mini Apps authentication**: For when you want your bots and mini-apps to feel right at home.  

## Experimental Feature Alert! 🚧  
We’ve got a **Vue 3 dashboard generator** for managing model content! 🛠️  
It’s still in the *playground phase*—think of it as a fun test bed for trying out cool ideas and hypotheses. The script scans controller, route, and model files to generate configurations for Vue.

Well, it’s not *perfect* for complex projects yet. The plan is to switch to a more predictable flow:  
✨ Add comments above the controllers or routes you want in the dashboard, then let the script parse only those.

	</video>

</div>

## Why JavaScript?  
Because sometimes you need to take a break from the *strict world of type tables* and go back to basics. 🥹 Let’s remember the simpler times before we traded code for type-safe tablecloths!

Check out an example below and don’t forget—you can always peek at the code on GitHub. 📂 Happy coding! 😎
