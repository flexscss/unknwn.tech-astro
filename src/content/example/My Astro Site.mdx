Hey there! This is my little corner of the web, built on Astroâ€”a playground for small projects and experiments.  

Previously, this site ran on Nuxt 2, which, letâ€™s be honest, sounds *so 2020* (and kind of scandalous in 2024, haha).  
I decided to switch to a lightweight MPA that still lets me write in Vue when needed.  

### Why Not Nuxt 3? ðŸ¤”  
Well, I wanted to try something fresh. Astroâ€™s concept intrigued me, and honestly, Iâ€™m all about keeping things snappy and functional. This site, for instance, is mainly for content, so why drag in a bunch of JavaScript? You donâ€™t need it to read text, right?  

Technology evolves, but somehow websites keep getting slower. Modern frontend sometimes feels like we're building a landing page with a FAANG-level stack. Come on, peopleâ€”letâ€™s simplify! Luckily, the trend seems to be heading in that direction.  

import GithubLink from '@/components/astro/markdown/GithubLink.astro'

<GithubLink href="https://github.com/flexscss/unknwn.tech-astro" />

import Lighthouse from '@/assets/images/examples/my-astro-site/lighthouse.png'

Oh, and hereâ€™s a pretty picture for you. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š

<div class="flex items-center justify-center">
	<Image src={Lighthouse} alt="Lighthouse" class="w-[150%] sm:w-[100%] rounded-2xl max-w-none" />
</div>
