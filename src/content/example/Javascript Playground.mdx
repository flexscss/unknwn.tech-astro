import Container from '@/components/astro/markdown/Container.astro'

<Container>

The idea came from tools like JSFiddle, but I wanted something simpler and more focused, just for messing around. It’s built with TypeScript, Vue 3, CodeMirror, and TailwindCSS, which made it super fun to put together.

## ✨ What makes it cool?

- You can play with code and see the results live.
- It’s lightweight and easy to throw into any small project.
- Built with modern tools, so it’s snappy and clean.

It’s not a polished product, just a playground for fellow code enthusiasts to experiment and have fun!

**Play around with it!** The component is right below — you can resize the panels, and changes are applied with a 1-second debounce to keep things smooth.
