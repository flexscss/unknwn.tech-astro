Caravane Earth is an international foundation with a mission to seed, practice and promote ethical entrepreneurship and wellbeing through art, craft, architecture, agriculture, and education. We work towards positive systemic impact in social, cultural, and ecological realms.

## The realization
### Backend
The backend is written with node.js (express) and we used MongoDB to store and manipulate the data.

### Frontend
The frontend part is written on Vue.js, Nuxt.js, pug and scss.

### Solution
As a result, we got a fast, modern site with lots types of content. Complex interactive elements were made, such as a map of the village. The whole project was divided into components, which makes it very easy to create new pages from blocks as in the constructor using the unique admin panel.

import caravane1 from '@/images/cases/caravane/caravane1.jpg'

<BigImage src={caravane1} alt="Case showcase" />

### Management interface parts
Some page controls are displayed here, allowing you to easily modify and create content for the site.

import caravane2 from '@/images/cases/caravane/caravane2.jpg'

<BigImage src={caravane2} alt="Case showcase" />
